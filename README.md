## Remote Setup

### Pointing Devices

#### Trackballs

- [Kensington Expert Trackball](https://www.kensington.com/en-ca/p/products/control/trackballs/expert-mouse-optical-trackball/) - A larger, ambidextrous trackball that works well in between the halves of a split keyboard. Buttons are programmable using Kensington's software (available on Mac or Windows).
- [Ploopy Classic](https://ploopy.co/classic-trackball/) - A [QMK](https://qmk.fm/)-based 3D printed programmable trackball for larger hands. Can be ordered as a parts kit or assembled.

### Desks

- [Fully Jarvis](https://www.fully.com/standing-desks/jarvis.html) - Many hangops members swear by their Fully Jarvis sit/stand desks.
- [UpLift](https://www.upliftdesk.com/) - Similar to Fully Jarvis. Wide range of customizations in size/color/material.
- [VIVO](https://vivo-us.com/) - VIVO is a lower cost option than others but has a great product and an excellent support team.
- [Uppeal](https://www.uppealdesign.com/) - Uppeal desks have a hieght range of 14.7 to 46.7 inches. Can also be purchased as just a frame.

### Desk Frames

Desk frames are the lower parts of the desk (i.e. not the flat part on top). They're useful if you have an existing desk top that you want to preserve or want to have a custom top such as a wood/epoxy creation.

### Chairs

- [Herman Miller Aeron](https://www.hermanmiller.com/en_gb/products/seating/office-chairs/aeron-chairs/) - Nobody got fired for buying an Aeron
- [Steelcase Leap](https://www.steelcase.com/products/office-chairs/leap/) - strong competitor in the same price range as the Aeron.

**Note:** chairs can often be bought refurbished or second hand from office surplus/used furniture stores, sometimes for 50% or more off the price, so search around if you're on a budget, or even just to try out different chairs before ordering one online.

### Other Accessories

- [Ergodriven Topo](https://ergodriven.com/products/topo?variant=27365321411) - A standing mat can help reduce fatigue from standing for longer periods.

## Homelab

### Mini PCs

- [Beelink U59 Pro](https://a.co/d/d0W0UDZ) - 4c/4t 11th gen Intel CPU with QuickSync, 2x GbE NICs, m.2 SATA boot drive plus a 2.5" SATA slot

### Distributions / Operating Systems

- [Talos](https://talos.dev) - An immutable, Kubernetes-focused distribution. Great for quickly and easily bootstrapping Kubernetes clusters in the cloud or on bare metal
